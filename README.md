# Plant-Disease-Detection
The Plant Disease Detection AI system is a deep learning-based solution designed to identify plant diseases accurately and efficiently using image processing. At its core, it leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically a pretrained MobileNetV2 model, for robust feature extraction and classification. The AI analyzes leaf images, detecting visual patterns such as color variations, textures, and lesions to predict specific plant diseases with high precision.

This system integrates seamlessly with IoT devices for real-time monitoring, where environmental data like humidity, temperature, and soil pH is collected alongside image data to provide holistic plant health insights. A user-friendly mobile application allows farmers and agronomists to capture and upload images, receive immediate diagnosis results, and access recommendations for treatment or prevention. By combining deep learning, IoT, and a mobile platform, this project aims to revolutionize agricultural practices, reduce crop losses, and promote sustainable farming through accessible and scalable technology.
